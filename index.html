<p class="sans">POSTED 15 OCTOBER 2015</p>
<p class="preview">One year ago, TAHMO entered the Global Resilience Challenge, a three-stage competitive grant process funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, USAID, and Sida. The challenge is a response to growing recognition that resilience to disasters and chronic crises will be critical to preserving and continuing global efforts to reduce poverty and promote development in the 21st century.</p>

<p class="sans">POSTED 20 AUGUST 2015</p>
<p class="preview">President Obama made history last month by becoming the first sitting U.S. president to travel to Kenya. In the days leading up to his visit, CNN created controversy by labeling Kenya a "terror hotbed." The hashtag #SomeoneTellCNN quickly began trending worldwide, with many Kenyans calling out the news network for inaccurate and biased reporting. Tony Maddox, a CNN executive vice president and managing director, later flew to Kenya to apologize directly to President Uhuru Kenyatta.</p>

<p class="preview">The millennial generation is being described in an ever-increasing number of ways. Search Google News for "millennials" and you will undoubtedly find an article purporting to have discovered some basic truth about this mysterious generation. These articles make sweeping claims about what millennials want: careers that give them purpose, products that allow them to express their individuality, apps that make their lives more convenient, and organic fair trade coffee to remind everyone of how enlightened they are.</p>

<p class="sans">POSTED 7 APRIL 2015</p>
<p class="preview">Knowing the weather is critical for agriculture. This is as true in Africa as it is anywhere else. Unfortunately, smallholder African farmers are often at the mercy of the weather. Droughts can decimate an entire year's crop, leading to dire consequences for farmers who are dependent on farming for their livilihood.</p>

<p class="preview">I'm now three months into my work as East Africa Field Director for TAHMO. Things have been moving quickly. In the month of March alone I've participated in a UNDP workshop in Kampala, met with the board of directors of the Uganda National Meteorological Authority, presented at the Global Forum on Innovations in Agriculture in Abu Dhabi, and attended the Global Resilience Partnership workshop in Nairobi. It's been quite a learning experience representing TAHMO among such a variety of audiences.</p>

<p class="preview">Having finished school I'm now back in Kenya to work for TAHMO full time. My official title is East Africa Field Director. I'm stoked to be starting my professional career with an organization that challenges me and demands my best work. My responsibilities include managing local staff, negotiating agreements with national meteorological agencies in East Africa, meeting with clients, and of course installing weather stations. I have a full plate of tasks in front of me but I believe I work best under these conditions when the stakes are high and there is little room for error.</p>

<p class="sans">POSTED 4 JULY 2014</p>
<p class="preview">Back in Oregon! My Boren Fellowship is officially over and I'm now stateside for the first time since my Christmas vacation six months ago. It was such a privilege for me to spend nine months in Kenya as a Boren Fellow. From an academic perspective it provided me the opportunity to carry out research to use as the basis of my thesis. Professionally, I had the opportunity to continue laying the foundation for TAHMO's success in Kenya, which may result in my return to Kenya next year. Lastly, Boren provided a way for me to reconnect with many folks in Kenya that I met during my time with Engineers Without Borders, especially those from Lela.</p>

<p class="sans">POSTED 27 MAY 2014</p>
<p class="preview">In one of my first posts I described three goals I have for my time in Kenya: learn Swahili, conduct research for my master's thesis, and pilot TAHMO. As of this month I’ve completed my third and final Swahili class; I'm not fluent but I’ve made significant progress from where I was eight months ago. (After I return home I will be tested to place my Swahili ability on a language proficiency scale.) Last week I wrote about my new research topic and how I will use that for my master's thesis. So, of my three original goals, that leaves piloting TAHMO.</p>

<p class="sans">POSTED 21 MAY 2014</p>
<p class="preview">When I received a Boren Fellowship to come to Kenya, my plan was to research the impact of weather insurance. I wrote about this in one of my first posts so I won't dwell on the subject. Suffice it to say the idea was that I would interview two groups of farmers: those who have weather insurance and those who don't. The difference between the two groups is the impact of the insurance, which is designed to protect farmers from drought and thus help alleviate poverty. My job was to investigate how effective weather insurance was for actually accomplishing this goal. After previously writing a letter of support for my fellowship application and saying they were excited to work with me, for reasons I won't get into here the weather insurance organization I had partnered with decided to cancel the project.</p>

<p class="sans">POSTED 24 FEBRUARY 2014</p>
<p class="preview">Life in Kenya is a tale of two worlds. On the one hand you have the bustling cities of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru, and others where about a third of Kenya's 43 million people live. Life in these cities is fast, crowded, and loud. On the other hand you have vast areas of rural towns and villages where the remaining two-thirds of Kenyans live. Life in these areas is slow, quiet, and peaceful. Urban dwellers typically have access to running water, electricity, transportation, grocery stores, movie theaters, and most of the modern amenities you might expect (the exception is the portion of people living in urban slums). In rural areas however people often fetch water 20 liters at a time, they depend on subsistence farming for food and a modest income, and their primary mode of transportation is by foot or bicycle.</p>

<p class="preview">Having been in Kenya for three months now, I'm officially one third of the way through my Boren Fellowship. It's been an exciting time for me as I learn Swahili and adjust to life in Nairobi. I've just returned to the city after a two week vacation to be home for the holidays. It was wonderful to see family and friends, if only for a short time. On my way back I routed myself through Chicago for my friend Sneha's wedding (enjoy your honeymoon!) which was beautiful. So I'm now ready to get started with the next stage of my journey here.</p>

<p class="sans">POSTED 23 OCTOBER 2013</p>
<p class="preview">Lela is a rural village in the southwest corner of Kenya, near Lake Victoria and the Tanzanian border. The community is made up of about 2,000 people who get by on subsistence farming. I first visited Lela in June 2011 as a member of Engineers Without Borders. The Oregon State University chapter of EWB had partnered with Lela to develop a solution to the community's need for safe, accessible water. Women and children were wasting precious hours of the day walking several kilometers to gather water during the dry season. In addition, surface water sources available in the wet season were highly contaminated and were causing waterborne illnesses.</p>

<p class="preview">I've been in Nairobi now just under a week, and so far so good. A wrench was thrown in my plans when the language institute where I intended to study apparently closed, so I am taking classes at the National Museums of Kenya instead. The class started the day after I arrived, and I'm now through the first week of lessons. My favorite Swahili word so far: juzi, which means "the day before yesterday". How convenient is that? Somebody please invent an English equivalent so I can stop saying "the day before yesterday".</p>
