<h1>Defending my MPP Essay</h1>
<p class="sans">POSTED 23 OCTOBER 2014</p>
<p>I've been back home for about four months now, wrapping up my master's degree while keeping TAHMO-related activities moving. Some exciting news is that TAHMO was selected to receive grant funding from the Securing Water for Food Challenge, funded by USAID (among others). That means I will be headed back to Kenya in January as TAHMO's East Africa Field Director. But before I embark on that journey I need to wrap things up at OSU. The greatest task is defending my Master of Public Policy essay. Much like a thesis, this is the last step to finishing my master's degree. I am proud to report that I successfully defended my essay "The Case for Remote Monitoring: Evidence from Kenya" last Friday, October 17. I couldn't have done it without the support of my friends and family, my committee, everyone who supported my Boren Fellowship application, the OSU chapter of Engineers Without Borders, and especially the community of Lela, Kenya. I was also lucky enough to have my brother Colin present for my defense, which he filmed. I will have more to report on my return to Kenya as January approaches, but for now check out the video of my defense:</p>
